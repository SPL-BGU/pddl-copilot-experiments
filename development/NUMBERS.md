# NUMBERS.md — the one lookup before you quote a figure

**Purpose.** Several headline figures exist at more than one value across the docs,
because a reading was revised after the first write-up. Every stale value is
banner-marked where it lives, but that means trusting a banner in each of six files.
This table replaces that: **one row per figure, the frozen value, where it is
provenanced, and the readings it replaces.**

**Rule.** Before any figure enters paper prose, check it here. If it is not in this
table, run `/verify-claims` against the canonical corpora
(`results/sweep5v2-live` + `*_sweep6`; **never** `results/sweep5-cluster-20260530`,
a stale partial mirror). Every value below was re-verified against its provenance
file on 2026-08-29.

## PlanBench — with-tools arm (CLOSED 2026-08-06/11; Act 4)

Provenance for all rows: `planbench/planbench_wt_results_20260803.md`.
Binding constraints on use: `planbench/PLANBENCH_WT_FINAL_PHASE_HANDOFF.md`.

| figure | **quote this** | line | do NOT quote |
|---|---|---|---|
| clean WT accuracy | **68.3** [64.5, 71.9], 410/600 — *first-draw* | L23, L103 | **69.7** (last-attempt reading, L17) |
| clean WT paired Δ vs matched-NT | **+20.5pp**, b=202/c=79, McNemar **p=1.38e-13** | L23 | **+21.8pp**, p=2.7e-15 (last-attempt, L32) |
| Mystery WT | **71.8** [68.1, 75.3] vs NT **0.0** — paired Δ +71.8pp | L19, L30 | — |
| bare-NT clean | **43.8** [39.9, 47.8], 263/600 — CI-disjoint above GPT-4 | L108, L196 | — |
| GPT-4 reference line (2023, published grader) | clean **34.3** [30.6, 38.2]; Mystery **4.3** | L102, L198 | — *(reference line, never a comparator)* |
| matched-NT stripped-block regrade | **4.3** [3.0, 6.3], 26/600 | L254 | graded **0.0** — carries the injection caveat |
| formalization_match | clean **96.3** [94.5, 97.6] · Mystery **97.8** [96.3, 98.7] | L147 | — |

The first-draw-vs-last-attempt split is Omer's 2026-08-06 call ("the 1 pt is not
worth the ambiguity"). Cause: 18 instances were re-attempted on a resume and are
effectively best-of-2 while every other instance is single-shot; first-draw counts
the re-draws as failures. Full derivation: results doc deviation row 1 (L293).

## Frontier e2e — delivered vs tool-verified

Provenance: `sonnet_wt_vs_haiku_e2e_memo.md` (canonical corpus, variant 11,
`e2e_strict`). **Delivered is the primary surface**; tool-verified is the mechanism
layer (journal memo §3 / D-J2).

| figure | **quote this** | do NOT quote |
|---|---|---|
| solve delivered, with tools | **95.0** [88.8, 97.8] — *both* Sonnet and Haiku; tool-verified 100.0, gap **+5.0pp** | **13.5% — RETRACTED**, an overlay grading artifact |
| simulate delivered, with tools | **bounds, not points**: Sonnet **[49.0, 62.0]**, Haiku **[52.0, 64.0]** | **0% — RETRACTED**, same artifact |
| simulate delivered↔tool-verified gap | ≈37–50pp Sonnet · ≈33–45pp Haiku (length-driven) | a single pooled "≈35–45" figure |
| simulate, no-tools | **[0, 100] — 100% censored**, both models | any point estimate |
| validation tasks (vd/vp/vplan) | gap ≈0.0pp; delivered ≈ tool-verified | — |

The retracted 13.5 / 0.0 pair is the single most dangerous stale number in the tree:
it was published in earlier drafts before the overlay bug was found. Anything quoting
a frontier solve or simulate figure below ~90 / outside those bands is pre-retraction.

## Corpus scale

| figure | **quote this** | provenance | do NOT quote |
|---|---|---|---|
| open-weight trial count | **273,600** across two corpora, **five** open-weight models | `title_abstract_candidates.md` §4 (L324) | **227k** — does not reproduce from disk; never pair any total with "seven models" |

`journal_decisions_memo.md` still uses 227k in three places (§5, §8, and its revision
line); the memo carries a correction banner at its head. 273,600 = 5 models × 2
reasoning modes × 3 arms × 4,560 × 2 corpora.

## Not yet in this table

- **nt-ster H4** (the steering falsification control) completed 2026-08-29 on the
  unpushed branch `run/ntster-h4`; its readout doc is not on `main` yet. Add its
  rows here when that branch merges. Until then take nt-ster figures only from
  `ntster_h4_final_readout_20260829.md` on branch `run/ntster-h4`
  (not on `main` yet, so the path does not resolve here).
- Single-tool suite headline numbers: still to be pinned as Job 2 writes. Use
  `/verify-claims` per figure until they land here.
